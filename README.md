# morphogen_profile

While all files reference Fig2 in name, the python script fig2gen.py actually produces Figs. 3A and 3B from our manuscript, while Fig2gen.mat and Fig2steep.mat produce separate, much older versions of Fig. 4 from our manuscript. These old versions of Fig. 4 were editted in image editting software to create the final version of Fig. 4. As such, they have not been updated to reflect the final version used in the manuscript.
